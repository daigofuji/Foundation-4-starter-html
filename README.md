Foundation-4-starter-html
=========================

I love zurb's Foundation. I've noticed when I start a new project, a pattern of doing the same thing over and over.
So, here is my starter file.

Goal is not to replace template, you can still use that 
http://foundation.zurb.com/templates.php

but rather, have stuff in the header or footer (SEO stuff, Open Graph, google analytics, google fonts, font-awesome etc).

Also, I've added off-canvas layout 
http://foundation.zurb.com/off-canvas.php
for foundation 4.

I created this for my personal use, but if you'd like to use it, please feel free. 
Shout out to http://daigo.org or @DaigoFuji are appreciated.
